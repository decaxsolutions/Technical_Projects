# AWS IAM

As cloud adoption continues to grow, so do the risks associated with improper access management and security configurations. This project focuses on enhancing the security posture of an AWS-hosted web application by implementing Identity and Access Management (IAM) best practices. By addressing the core challenges in access control, we aim to demonstrate how strategic IAM configurations can mitigate risks such as unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and data breaches.

AWS IAM provides a robust framework for managing user access, enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA), and monitoring activities across cloud environments. This project will explore these features to deliver a secure, scalable, and compliant infrastructure.
